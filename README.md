# 2022 NBA Finals Simulation
Boston Celtics vs Golden State Warriors

Boston and Golden State are meeting for the 2022 NBA Finals.  I have a simple simulation based on team points scored and team points scored against (opponent scores).  I initially ran this simulation with Miami and Golden State after Golden State secured the Western Conference title. In that simulation, I had Golden State winning the Finals. I was fairly certain Miami had the Eastern Conference in the bag but it came down to a game 7 and Boston ended up winning.  So after redoing the simulation, now I have Boston winning the Finals
