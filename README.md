# 2022 NBA Finals Simulation
Boston Celtics vs Golden State Warriors
## Update
Boy was my simulation way off. Golden St won the series 4-2.  Note to self: need to improve the sim.


Boston and Golden State are meeting for the 2022 NBA Finals.  I have a simple simulation(monte carlo method) based on team points scored and team points scored against (opponent scores).  I initially ran this simulation with Miami and Golden State after Golden State secured the Western Conference title. In that simulation, I had Golden State winning the Finals. I was fairly certain Miami had the Eastern Conference in the bag but it came down to a game 7 and Boston ended up winning.  So after redoing the simulation, now I have Boston winning the Finals
